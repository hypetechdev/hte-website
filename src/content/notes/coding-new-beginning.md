It time to add some content to my blog. You can expect new posts soon. I will write about my experience with Astro and other web technologies. I will also write about my experience with learning new things and how I manage to do it. I hope you will find it interesting and useful. 

Idea behind a notes section is to have a place where I can write down my thoughts and ideas. I will use it a place to share knowledge and experience. I will also use it as a place to keep track of my progress learning new things. 

I will try to keep it simple and write about things that I find interesting and use on a daily bases. I will try to keep it short and to the point. I will try to keep it educative and useful, fun and interesting. I will make a educated guess that I will fail at some of these things. But I will try to do my best.
