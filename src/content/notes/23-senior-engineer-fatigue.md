> Senior fatigue is, perhaps paradoxically, a sign of maturity in engineering. It's an indicator that you’re transitioning from doing everything to ensuring that everything that needs to be done gets done in the most effective way. As for the younger engineers looking to one day step into those shoes, value these moments of apparent slowdown—they're the unspoken lessons in how to endure and excel in an ever-demanding field.
