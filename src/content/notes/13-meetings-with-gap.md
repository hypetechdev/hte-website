Every meeting should have a **Goal**, **Agenda** and **Preparation**. Insist on a GAP or don’t go. Follow the law of two feet. If you aren’t helping or being helped, walk out.

Structure meetings for efficiency. Preparation happens before the meeting. You don’t need five people to watch one person look up numbers in a report. That one person screwed everyone by not preparing. Order the agenda items so that people can be excused early for issues that aren’t pertinent to them.

If you make a decision to do something, write it down in a place where you can track it and share it after meeting.
Don't send presentations (PowerPoint or any other) try sending around a memo instead. Long form writing requires clear thinking and communication.

For healthy discussion, you need a minimum of three ideas. One idea is a bad idea. Two ideas is an argument. Three ideas is a discussion.

#### Things that are important for an effective meeting

-   Having an agenda, agreed upon up front, is important.
-   Starting on time (or rescheduling if you cannot start on time) is important.
-   Ending on time (or rescheduling if you are not done) is important.
-   Agreeing upon action items and responsibilities is important.
-   Publishing minutes (at least a list of action items) is important.
-   Staying task-focused and not making personal attacks, having side conversations, or fiddling with your phone is important.

> **Give every participant the right to expect and demand that meetings are effective.**
