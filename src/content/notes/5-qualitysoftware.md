We know that writing quality software is hard and complex: It is not only about satisfying requirements, also should be robust, maintainable, testable, and flexible enough to adapt to growth and change. This is where “the clean architecture” comes up and could be a good approach for using when developing any software application.

Clean architecture stands for a group of practices that produce systems that are:

-   Independent of Frameworks.
-   Testable.
-   Independent of UI.
-   Independent of Database.
-   Independent of any external agency.
