> Always think about the “why” behind your work and make sure it aligns with what matters most to your team and company. It is easy to get sidetracked by interesting work that isn’t impactful. **The fastest career growth comes by finding work that aligns with both your interests and what matters most to the company.** The best engineers can quickly tell what work is most impactful. Discussing project prioritization with your manager and tech lead is the fastest way to develop this skill.
